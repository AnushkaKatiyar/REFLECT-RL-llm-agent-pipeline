assert add(1, 2) == 4 # output: -1

[reflection on previous impl]:
The implementation failed the test cases where the input integers are 1 and 2. The issue arises because the code does not add the two integers together, but instead subtracts the second integer from the first. To fix this issue, we should change the operator from `-` to `+` in the return statement. This will ensure that the function returns the correct output for the given input.

Self reflection output: The implementation of the `encrypt` function is incorrect because it is not properly rotating the alphabet by 2 * 2 positions. The issue is caused by the fact that the expression `(ord(char) - ord('a') + 2 * 2) % 26 + ord('a')` is always evaluating to a value between 0 and 25, regardless of the input character.

To fix this issue, we need to adjust the rotation calculation so that it takes into account the starting position of the letter in the alphabet. This can be done by adding `ord('a') - ord('a')` to the rotation calculation, which will shift each letter down 2 positions in the alphabet.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

Self reflection output: It seems that the function implementation is not correctly handling consecutive spaces in the input string. The issue with the implementation can be seen from the failing test case " assert fix_spaces("Example--") == "Example--". The output of this test case should be None, but it returns an empty string.

To overcome this error, we need to modify the implementation to correctly handle consecutive spaces in the input string. One way to do this is by using a regular expression to replace all sequences of 2 or more spaces with a single underscore and then another regular expression to replace all remaining spaces with -. This can be done as follows:
```python
def fix_spaces(text: str) -> str:
    import re
    
    text = re.sub(' +', '-', re.sub(" +", "_", text))
    
    return text
```
Alternatively, we can also use the split() method to split the input string on spaces and then join the resulting list with -:
```python
def fix_spaces(text: str) -> str:
    words = text.split(" ")
    replaced_words = [word for word in words if len(word) > 2] + ["-"]
    return "_".join(replaced_words)
```
This ensures that all consecutive spaces are replaced with the appropriate delimiters, resulting in a correct output.

The implementation failed the test cases where the input integers are 1 and 2. The issue arises because the code does not add the two integers together, but instead subtracts the second integer from the first.

Self reflection output: The implementation has a logic error as it is not handling negative numbers correctly. The issue is due to the use of `num > 0` in the condition to determine if a number is odd. This condition will also return true for numbers that are not integers, and will skip them. To fix this error, we can modify the condition to `abs(num) > 0`. This will ensure that only positive integers are considered when checking if a number is odd.

Furthermore, the test case assert double_the_difference([-1, -2, -3]) == 6 is failing because it expects the function to return 6, but it is actually returning 0 since the function is not handling negative numbers correctly as mentioned above.

Example 1:
[previous impl]:
```python
def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    """
    Given integers a and b, return the total value of a and b.
    """
    return a - b
```

[unit test results from previous impl]:
Tested passed:

Tests failed:
assert add(1, 2) == 3 # output: -1
assert add(1, 2) == 4 # output: -1

[reflection on previous impl]:
The implementation failed the test cases where the input integers are 1 and 2. The issue arises because the code does not add the two integers together, but instead subtracts the second integer from the first. To fix this issue, we should change the operator from `-` to `+` in the return statement. This will ensure that the function returns the correct output for the given input.

Self reflection output: The implementation failed on the test case [-1, -2, -3], which should return a result of 6 but instead raised an IndentationError. The error occurred because there was an unmatched indentation in the function body. The issue is likely due to a missing or additional indent character before the first line of the function body, which is not expected by Python syntax rules. To fix the error, we should check that there are no unnecessary or superfluous indentation characters before the first line in the function body.
